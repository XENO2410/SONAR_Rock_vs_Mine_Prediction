# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive system in Python to classify objects as either Rock or Mine using SONAR data. The Logistic Regression model is employed for this classification task. The programming and analysis are conducted in Google Colaboratory.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Import and Exploration
- The SONAR dataset is imported into the Google Colaboratory environment.
- Initial exploration of the dataset is performed to understand the structure and contents.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- The dataset is cleaned to handle any missing values or inconsistencies.
- Features and target variables are separated for model training.
- Data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### 3. Model Building
- A Logistic Regression model is built using the training data.
- Model parameters are tuned to optimize performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- The model is evaluated using the testing data.
- Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.

### 5. Prediction
- The trained model is used to make predictions on new data.
- Predictions are compared with actual values to further validate the model.

### 6. Conclusion
- Insights and conclusions from the model's performance are summarized.
- Potential improvements and future work are discussed.

## Dataset

- **SONAR Data**: The dataset used for this project contains information on objects detected by SONAR, with labels indicating whether the object is a Rock or a Mine.
